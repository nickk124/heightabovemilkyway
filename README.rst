Assuming that the Milky Way is flat, how far above the Galactic plane is the Earth, given radio astronomical observation of the Galaxy's arms? Was that even a good assumption to make? The answer *may* surprise you.

I worked this out one coffee-driven night at Green Bank Radio Observatory, West Virginia.
